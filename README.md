# Deploy Java Application on AWS – 3-Tier Architecture (Terraform)
 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a production-grade Java web application on AWS using a 3-Tier Architecture, fully automated with Terraform (Infrastructure as Code).

The architecture follows AWS best practices for scalability, security, availability, and maintainability.

 Architecture Summary

The application is divided into three independent tiers:

# 1️⃣ Presentation Tier (Frontend)

Nginx Web Servers

Auto Scaling Group

Public Application Load Balancer

Public Subnets

Internet Gateway

# 2️⃣ Application Tier (Backend)

Apache Tomcat (Java Application)

Auto Scaling Group

Internal Load Balancer

Private Subnets

Session management via Redis (optional)

# 3️⃣ Data Tier

Amazon RDS MySQL

Multi-AZ Deployment

Automated Backups

Private Subnets

# Network Design

Two VPCs:

Frontend VPC: 192.168.0.0/16

Backend VPC: 172.32.0.0/16

Public & Private subnets across multiple AZs

Secure communication using Security Groups

Optional Transit Gateway for VPC-to-VPC connectivity

# Security Features

Tier-based Security Groups (least privilege)

Private subnets for backend & database

No direct public access to application or database

IAM roles for EC2 access

Data encryption at rest and in transit

# Prerequisites

AWS Account

IAM User with Admin access

AWS CLI configured

Terraform installed (v1.x)

Key pair created in AWS

# Deployment Steps
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/A4671satya/Java-Application.git
cd aws-3tier-terraform

2️⃣ Initialize Terraform
terraform init

3️⃣ Validate Configuration
terraform validate

4️⃣ Preview Infrastructure
terraform plan

5️⃣ Deploy Infrastructure
terraform apply


Type yes when prompted.

# Access Application

After deployment, Terraform outputs the Load Balancer DNS name.

http://<frontend-alb-dns-name>

# Monitoring & Scaling

Auto Scaling based on CPU utilization

CloudWatch metrics and alarms

High availability across multiple AZs

✅ Success Criteria

✔ Application accessible via public URL
✔ Auto Scaling works under load
✔ Database connectivity established
✔ Secure network isolation
✔ Production-ready architecture

# Interview Explanation (Short)

“This project uses Terraform to deploy a highly available AWS 3-tier architecture with Nginx, Tomcat, and RDS. Each tier is isolated, scalable, and secured following AWS best practices.”

# Future Enhancements

Add CloudFront CDN

Enable AWS WAF

Implement CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Blue-Green deployment

Add Redis (ElastiCache) for sessions
